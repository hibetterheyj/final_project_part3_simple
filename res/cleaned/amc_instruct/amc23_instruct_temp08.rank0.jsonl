We take the derivative and set it to zero:\n\\[ f'(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta(1 + 2\\cos\\theta) + \\sin\\theta(-2\\sin\\theta) = \\cos\\theta + 2\\cos^2\\theta - 2\\sin^2\\theta. \\]\nUsing the Pythagorean identity \\( \\sin^2\\theta = 1 - \\cos^2\\theta \\), we get:\n\\[ f'(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta + 2\\cos^2\\theta - 2(1 - \\cos^2\\theta) = \\cos\\theta + 2\\cos^2\\theta - 2 + 2\\cos^2\\theta = 4\\cos^2\\theta + \\cos\\theta - 2. \\]\nSetting \\( f'(\\theta) = 0 \\), we solve the quadratic equation:\n\\[ 4\\cos^2\\theta + \\cos\\theta - 2 = 0. \\]\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( \\cos\\theta = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\) with \\( a = 4 \\), \\( b = 1 \\), and \\( c = -2 \\), we get:\n\\[ \\cos\\theta = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 32}}{8} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{33}}{8}. \\]\nThe value of \\( \\cos\\theta \\) that maximizes \\( f(\\theta) \\) is \\( \\cos\\theta = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{33}}{8} \\).

To find the probability of reaching 10, we need the coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) in the expansion of \\( G(x)^{10} \\):\n\\[\nG(x)^{10} = \\left( \\frac{x}{2 - x} \\right)^{10} = \\frac{x^{10}}{(2 - x)^{10}}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\( x^{10} \\) in \\( \\frac{x^{10}}{(2 - x)^{10}} \\) is the same as the coefficient of \\( x^0 \\) in \\( \\frac{1}{(2 - x)^{10}} \\). The expansion of \\( \\frac{1}{(2 - x)^{10}} \\) is given by the binomial series:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{(2 - x)^{10}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{k + 9}{9} \\left( \\frac{x}{2} \\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{k + 9}{9} \\frac{x^k}{2^k}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\( x^0 \\) is \\( \\binom{9 + 9}{9} \\frac{1}{2^0} = \\binom{18}{9} \\).

Using the Euclidean algorithm, we find that the GCD is 2, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 2:\n\\[\n\\frac{24310 \\div 2}{512 \\div 2} = \\frac{12155}{256}\n\\]\nThe probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is \\( \\frac{12155}{256} \\).

The first row is: \\(1\\)\n2. The second row is: \\(1 \\, 1\\)\n3. The third row is: \\(1 \\, 3 \\, 1\\)\n4. The fourth row is: \\(1 \\, 5 \\, 5 \\, 1\\)\n5.

This can be proven by induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\( n = 1 \\), \\( S_1 = 1 = 2^{1-1} = 2^0 = 1 \\).\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume \\( S_k = 2^{k-1} \\) for some \\( k \\geq 1 \\). We need to show that \\( S_{k+1} = 2^k \\).\n\nThe sum of the numbers in the \\( (k+1) \\)-th row is the sum of the first number, the sum of the interior numbers, and the last number. The first and last numbers are both 1, and the interior numbers are each 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above them in the \\( k \\)-th row. Therefore, the sum of the interior numbers in the \\( (k+1) \\)-th row is \\( S_k + S_k = 2S_k \\).\n\nThus, \\( S_{k+1} = 1 + 2S_k + 1 = 2 + 2S_k = 2(1 + S_k) = 2 \\cdot 2^{k-1} = 2^k \\).\n\nBy induction, the sum of the numbers in the \\( n \\)-th row is \\( S_n = 2^{n-1} \\).\n\nFor the 2023rd row, the sum is \\( S_{2023} = 2^{2022} \\).

Since \\( 2022 \\mod 4 = 2 \\), the units digit of \\( 2^{2022} \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 2^2 \\), which is 4.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."}

We will use symmetry and combinatorial arguments to simplify the problem.\n\nConsider the possible values for \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\):\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2, 3, or 4.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3 or 4.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can only be 4.\n\nWe need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).

Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is half of the probability that \\(d(Q, R) \\neq d(R, S)\\).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) is \\(12 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1320\\).

Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \\(\\frac{1050}{2} = 525\\).\n\nThe probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{525}{1320} = \\frac{35}{88}\\). The sum of the numerator and the denominator is \\(35 + 88 = 123\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{123}\\)."}

A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices can be divided into two sets of 6 vertices each, such that every vertex in one set is connected to every vertex in the other set by an edge that is not part of any face of the icosahedron. This structure is known as a bipartite graph.\n\nGiven that the icosahedron is bipartite, any two vertices in the same set are at a distance of 2 (since they are connected by a path of two edges), and any two vertices in different sets are at a distance of 1 (since they are directly connected by an edge).\n\nLet's denote the two sets of vertices as \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), each containing 6 vertices. Without loss of generality, let \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) be two vertices chosen from different sets, so \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\).

The number of ways to choose \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) such that they are from different sets is \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) (since there are 6 vertices in each set).

The vertices of a regular icosahedron can be divided into two sets of 6 vertices each, such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to a vertex from the other set. This is known as a bipartite graph, where the distance between any two vertices in the same set is 2, and the distance between any two vertices in different sets is 1.\n\nGiven that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$, we need to consider the possible distances between the vertices. The possible distances between any two vertices in a regular icosahedron are 1, 2, and 3. However, since $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$, the only possible scenario is that $d(Q, R) = 3$ and $d(R, S) = 2$. This is because if $d(Q, R) = 1$, then $d(R, S)$ must be less than 1, which is not possible. And if $d(Q, R) = 2$, then $d(R, S)$ must be less than 2, which means $d(R, S) = 1$.

For each choice of $Q$ (6 vertices), there are 6 vertices at a distance of 2 from $R$. This is because each vertex at a distance of 3 from $R$ is connected to 3 vertices at a distance of 2 from $R$, and there are 2 such vertices in the same set.\n\nSo, the number of ways to choose $Q$ and $S$ for each choice of $R$ is $6 \\times 6 = 36$.

If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then \\(d(R, S) = 5\\).\n\nWe need to count the number of favorable outcomes for each case and then sum them up. However, a more efficient way is to use symmetry and the fact that each distance is equally likely to be the maximum of the three distances. Since there are 5 vertices at each distance and the total number of vertices is 12, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and these two probabilities together with the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) sum to 1. Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 vertices out of 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} = 220\\). Since the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the number of favorable outcomes is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 220 = 110\\). Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{110}{220} = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the sum of the numerator and the denominator is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\).\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."}

If \\(x = y\\), then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(1 + x)(2 + x)(x + x) = 4x^2\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(1 + x)(2 + x)(2x) = 4x^2\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1 + x)(2 + x)(2x) = (1 + x)(4x + 2x^2) = 4x + 2x^2 + 4x^2 + 2x^3 = 4x + 6x^2 + 2x^3\n\\]\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 + 6x^2 + 4x = 4x^2\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(4x^2\\) from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n2x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\(2x\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n2x(x^2 + x + 2) = 0\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) is a positive real number, \\(2x \\neq 0\\). Therefore, we need to solve:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + x + 2 = 0\n\\]\n\nThe discriminant of this quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[\n1^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 = 1 - 8 = -7\n\\]\n\nSince the discriminant is negative, there are no real solutions to this equation. Therefore, there are no positive real solutions for \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) when \\(x = y\\).\n\nNext, let's try another approach by testing specific values. Suppose \\(a = \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(b = 1\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2})(2 + 2 \\cdot 1)(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1) = (1 + 1)(2 + 2)(1 + 1) = 2 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 16\n\\]\n\nAnd:\n\n\\[\n32 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 1 = 16\n\\]\n\nSo \\((a, b) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right)\\) is a solution. By symmetry, \\((a, b) = \\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\) is also a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions. However, the structure of the equation and the symmetry suggest that these are the only solutions.\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]"}

The running total can be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 2 and the last roll is 1, or if the running total before the last roll is 1 and the last roll is 2, or if the running total before the last roll is 0 and the last roll is 3. However, since the die only has faces numbered from 1 to 6, the only valid sequences are those that involve rolling a 3 at some point.\n\nThe possible sequences of rolls that lead to a running total of 3 are:\n1. (3)\n2. (1, 2)\n3. (2, 1)\n4. (1, 1, 1)\n\nNow, we need to count the number of sequences of four rolls that include at least one of these valid sequences.

We will break this down by considering the running total after each roll:\n\n1. **After the first roll:**\n   - The running total is 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6.\n\n2. **After the second roll:**\n   - The running total must be 3 to reach 3 at some point. This can happen if the first roll is 3, or if the first roll is 1 and the second roll is 2, or if the first roll is 2 and the second roll is 1.\n\n3. **After the third roll:**\n   - The running total must be 3 to reach 3 at some point.

The only way this can happen is if the running total is 3 after the first roll, which is already counted. Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is simply the sum of the outcomes after each roll:\n\\[1 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 13\\]\n\nThe probability is then:\n\\[\\frac{13}{1296}\\]\n\nSince 13 and 1296 are relatively prime, the fraction is in its simplest form.

We need to find the probability that the running total of the numbers rolled equals 3 at least once during the four rolls. We will use complementary counting to find this probability.\n\n### Step 1: Total number of possible outcomes\nEach roll of a 6-sided die has 6 possible outcomes. Since Janet rolls the die 4 times, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Counting favorable outcomes\nWe need to count the number of sequences where the running total equals 3 at least once. Instead of directly counting these sequences, we will count the sequences where the running total never equals 3 and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.\n\n### Step 3: Sequences where the running total never equals 3\nWe will use a recursive approach to count the sequences where the running total never reaches 3. Let \\(a_n\\) be the number of sequences of length \\(n\\) where the running total never equals 3.\n\n#### Base cases:\n- \\(a_1\\): For a single roll, the possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.

We need to find the probability that the sum of the numbers rolled in any sequence of up to four rolls equals 3. We will use a combinatorial approach to count the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n### Step 1: Total Number of Possible Outcomes\nA standard 6-sided die has 6 faces, and Janet rolls it 4 times.

There is only 1 such sequence:\n\\[\n(3)\n\\]\n\n#### Case 2: Running Total is 3 after the Second Roll\nThe sum of the first two rolls must be 3. The possible pairs of rolls that sum to 3 are:\n\\[\n(1, 2) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (2, 1)\n\\]\nFor each pair, the third and fourth rolls must sum to 0, which is not possible since the minimum value on a die is 1.

The possible triples of rolls that sum to 3 are:\n\\[\n(1, 1, 1)\n\\]\nFor this triple, the fourth roll must be 0, which is not possible. Therefore, there are no favorable sequences in this case.\n\n#### Case 4: Running Total is 3 after the Fourth Roll\nThe sum of all four rolls must be 3. The possible quadruples of rolls that sum to 3 are:\n\\[\n(1, 1, 1, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1), (1, 0, 1, 1), (0, 1, 1, 1)\n\\]\nHowever, since the minimum value on a die is 1, none of these sequences are possible.

None of these equal 3, so:\n\\[\na_1 = 6\n\\]\n\n- For \\(n = 2\\), we consider sequences of length 2:\n  - If the first roll is 1, the second roll must be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  - If the first roll is 2, the second roll must be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  - If the first roll is 3, the second roll must be 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  - If the first roll is 4, the second roll must be 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  - If the first roll is 5, the second roll must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  - If the first roll is 6, the second roll must be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (not 3), giving 5 possibilities.\n  Thus, \\(a_2 = 5 \\times 6 = 30\\).\n\n### Recursive Relation:\nFor \\(n \\geq 3\\), the number of valid sequences of length \\(n\\) can be expressed as:\n\\[\na_n = 5a_{n-1}\n\\]\nThis is because for any valid sequence of length \\(n-1\\), the last roll can be any of the 5 values (not 3).\n\nUsing this relation, we can calculate:\n\\[\na_3 = 5a_2 = 5 \\times 30 = 150\n\\]\n\\[\na_4 = 5a_3 = 5 \\times 150 = 750\n\\]\n\n### Probability Calculation:\nThe number of sequences where the running total equals 3 at some point is the total number of sequences minus the number of sequences where the running total never equals 3:\n\\[\n1296 - 750 = 546\n\\]\n\nThe probability that the running total equals 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n\\frac{546}{1296}\n\\]\n\nWe simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 546 and 1296. Using the Euclidean algorithm:\n\\[\n1296 \\div 546 \\approx 2.36 \\quad \\text{(remainder 105)}\n\\]\n\\[\n546 \\div 105 \\approx 5.17 \\quad \\text{(remainder 21)}\n\\]\n\\[\n105 \\div 21 = 5 \\quad \\text{(remainder 0)}\n\\]\n\nThe GCD is 21. Thus, we simplify:\n\\[\n\\frac{546 \\div 21}{1296 \\div 21} = \\frac{26}{61.2857} \\approx \\frac{13}{30.6429}\n\\]\n\nFinally, the simplified form is:\n\\[\n\\frac{13}{36}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 13\\) and \\(n = 36\\), and \\(m + n = 13 + 36 = 49\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{49}\n\\]"}

Substituting the known values, we get:\n\\[\nt^2 - 12t + 16 = 0.\n\\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 1 \\), \\( b = -12 \\), and \\( c = 16 \\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\nThus, the \\( x \\)-coordinates of points \\( A \\) and \\( B \\) are \\( 6 + 2\\sqrt{5} \\) and \\( 6 - 2\\sqrt{5} \\). The positive difference between these \\( x \\)-coordinates is:\n\\[\n(6 + 2\\sqrt{5}) - (6 - 2\\sqrt{5}) = 4\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\nThe final answer is in the form \\( m \\sqrt{n} \\), where \\( m = 4 \\) and \\( n = 5 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n = 4 + 5 = 9 \\). The answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{9}.\n\\]"}
