The number of elements in the \\( n \\)-th row is \\( n \\).\n\nWe need to find the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row and determine the units digit of that sum. Let's denote the sum of the numbers in the \\( n \\)-th row by \\( S_n \\).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the sums for the first few rows:\n- For the 1st row: \\( S_1 = 1 \\)\n- For the 2nd row: \\( S_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \\)\n- For the 3rd row: \\( S_3 = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5 \\)\n- For the 4th row: \\( S_4 = 1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12 \\)\n- For the 5th row: \\( S_5 = 1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27 \\)\n\nWe observe that the sums form a sequence: \\( 1, 2, 5, 12, 27, \\ldots \\). Let's try to find a pattern in this sequence. We notice that each term is one less than a power of 3:\n- \\( S_1 = 3^1 - 2 = 1 \\)\n- \\( S_2 = 3^2 - 2 = 2 \\)\n- \\( S_3 = 3^3 - 2 = 5 \\)\n- \\( S_4 = 3^4 - 2 = 12 \\)\n- \\( S_5 = 3^5 - 2 = 27 \\)\n\nThis suggests that the sum of the numbers in the \\( n \\)-th row is \\( S_n = 3^n - 2 \\). We need to find the units digit of \\( S_{2023} = 3^{2023} - 2 \\).\n\nTo find the units digit of \\( 3^{2023} \\), we observe the pattern in the units digits of the powers of 3:\n- \\( 3^1 = 3 \\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\( 3^3 = 27 \\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\( 3^4 = 81 \\) (units digit is 1)\n- \\( 3^5 = 243 \\) (units digit is 3)\n- \\( 3^6 = 729 \\) (units digit is 9)\n- \\( 3^7 = 2187 \\) (units digit is 7)\n- \\( 3^8 = 6561 \\) (units digit is 1)\n\nWe see that the units digits repeat every 4 numbers: 3, 9, 7, 1. To find the units digit of \\( 3^{2023} \\), we need to determine the position of 2023 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 2023 is divided by 4:\n\\[ 2023 \\div 4 = 505 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\]\nSo, \\( 2023 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\). This means that the units digit of \\( 3^{2023} \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 3^3 \\), which is 7.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of \\( 3^{2023} - 2 \\) is \\( 7 - 2 = 5 \\).\n\nThe units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{5}\\)."}

Let's calculate a few more to confirm the pattern:\n\\[ S_8 = 1 + 13 + 31 + 45 + 45 + 31 + 13 + 1 = 195 \\]\n\\[ S_8 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10} \\]\n\\[ S_9 = 1 + 15 + 37 + 57 + 57 + 37 + 15 + 1 = 225 \\]\n\\[ S_9 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10} \\]\n\\[ S_{10} = 1 + 17 + 43 + 73 + 73 + 43 + 17 + 1 = 325 \\]\n\\[ S_{10} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{10} \\]\n\nFrom the above, we see that the units digits of the sums are 1, 2, 3, 6, 2, 2, 2, 5, 5, 5, ... and it seems to be repeating every 6 terms starting from \\(S_6\\). Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the 2023rd row is the same as the units digit of the sum of the 5th row, which is 2.\n\nThus, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{2}\\)."}

This can be proven by induction, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use this formula directly.\n\nThe sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row is:\n\\[ 2^{2023} - 1 \\]\n\nWe need to find the units digit of \\( 2^{2023} - 1 \\). The units digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating cycle: 2, 4, 8, 6. To find the units digit of \\( 2^{2023} \\), we need to determine the position of 2023 in this cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 2023 is divided by 4:\n\\[ 2023 \\div 4 = 505 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\]\nSo, the units digit of \\( 2^{2023} \\) is the same as the units digit of \\( 2^3 \\), which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of \\( 2^{2023} - 1 \\) is:\n\\[ 8 - 1 = 7 \\]\n\nThe units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is:\n\\[ \\boxed{7} \\]"}

Let's start by examining the first few rows and their sums.\n\nThe first few rows of the array are:\n1\n1 1\n1 3 1\n1 5 5 1\n1 7 11 7 1\n\nWe can observe that the sum of the numbers in each row forms a sequence. Let's calculate the sums:\n- The sum of the numbers in the 1st row is \\(1\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 2nd row is \\(1 + 1 = 2\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 3rd row is \\(1 + 3 + 1 = 5\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 4th row is \\(1 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 12\\).\n- The sum of the numbers in the 5th row is \\(1 + 7 + 11 + 7 + 1 = 27\\).\n\nWe can see that the sums are \\(1, 2, 5, 12, 27, \\ldots\\). This sequence is not immediately obvious, so let's look at the pattern more closely. Notice that the sum of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row is \\(2^{n} - 1\\). We can prove this by induction.\n\n**Base Case:** For \\(n = 1\\), the sum is \\(1 = 2^1 - 1\\), which is true.\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that the sum of the numbers in the \\(k\\)-th row is \\(2^k - 1\\). We need to show that the sum of the numbers in the \\((k+1)\\)-th row is \\(2^{k+1} - 1\\).\n\nThe \\((k+1)\\)-th row is formed by placing a 1 at each end of the \\((k-1)\\)-th row, and each interior entry is 1 greater than the sum of the two numbers diagonally above it in the \\((k-1)\\)-th row. Therefore, the sum of the numbers in the \\((k+1)\\)-th row is:\n\\[1 + \\sum_{i=2}^{k} (a_{i-1} + a_{i} + 1) + 1 = 2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} (a_i + 1) = 2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{k} a_i + k = 2 + (2^k - 1) + k = 2^{k+1} - 1.\\]\nThus, the sum of the numbers in the \\((k+1)\\)-th row is indeed \\(2^{k+1} - 1\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row. The sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(2^{2023} - 1\\). To find the units digit of \\(2^{2023} - 1\\), we need to find the units digit of \\(2^{2023}\\) and then subtract 1.\n\nThe units digits of the powers of 2 repeat every 4 numbers: \\(2, 4, 8, 6\\). To find the units digit of \\(2^{2023}\\), we need to determine the position of 2023 in the repeating cycle. We do this by finding the remainder when 2023 is divided by 4:\n\\[2023 \\div 4 = 505 \\text{ remainder } 3.\\]\nSo, the units digit of \\(2^{2023}\\) is the same as the units digit of \\(2^3\\), which is 8. Therefore, the units digit of \\(2^{2023} - 1\\) is \\(8 - 1 = 7\\).\n\nThus, the units digit of the sum of the 2023 numbers in the 2023rd row is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."}

Therefore, there are \\(12 \\times 5 \\times 2 \\times 1 / 2 = 60\\) pairs, but we must divide by 2, so there are 30 pairs such that \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\).\n- For \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), each vertex has 15 vertices at distance 4 (each of its 5 neighbors has 3 non-adjacent vertices, and each of those has 1 non-adjacent vertex not counted yet). Therefore, there are \\(12 \\times 5 \\times 3 \\times 1 / 2 = 90\\) pairs, but we must divide by 2, so there are 30 pairs such that \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\).\n- For \\(d(Q, R) = 5\\), each vertex has 15 vertices at distance 5 (each of its 5 neighbors has 3 non-adjacent vertices, and each of those has 1 non-adjacent vertex not counted yet).

Therefore, there are \\(30 \\times (30 + 30 + 30 + 30 + 30) = 30 \\times 150 = 4500\\) favorable outcomes.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4, 3, 2, or 1. There are 30 pairs for \\(d(Q, R) = 4\\), and for each of these, there are 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 4\\), 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 3\\), 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 2\\), and 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 1\\). Therefore, there are \\(30 \\times (30 + 30 + 30 + 30) = 30 \\times 120 = 3600\\) favorable outcomes.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3, 2, or 1. There are 30 pairs for \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), and for each of these, there are 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 3\\), 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 2\\), and 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 1\\). Therefore, there are \\(30 \\times (30 + 30 + 30) = 30 \\times 90 = 2700\\) favorable outcomes.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2 or 1. There are 30 pairs for \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), and for each of these, there are 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 2\\) and 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 1\\). Therefore, there are \\(30 \\times (30 + 30) = 30 \\times 60 = 1800\\) favorable outcomes.\n- If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can only be 1. There are 30 pairs for \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), and for each of these, there are 30 pairs for \\(d(R, S) = 1\\).

This gives us \\(12 \\times 5 \\times 5 / 2 = 150\\) outcomes for \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\).

A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices can be categorized into two groups: the \" poles\" and the \"equators\". The poles are the 2 vertices that are farthest apart, and the equators are the remaining 10 vertices.\n\nThe distance between two vertices in a regular icosahedron can be 1, 2, or 3. Specifically:\n- Distance 1: The vertices are connected by an edge.\n- Distance 2: The vertices are connected by traversing one edge from each vertex to a common vertex.\n- Distance 3: The vertices are not connected by traversing one or two edges, and the shortest path between them involves traversing two edges.\n\nThe key observation is that the distance between any two vertices is determined by their relative positions on the icosahedron. If we choose three vertices \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) randomly, we need to determine the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(S, Q)\\).

Therefore, the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the remaining outcomes. The number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the number of ways to choose three vertices such that the distances are equal. This is a bit more complicated to count directly, but we can use the fact that the total number of outcomes is 220 and the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is a subset of these outcomes.\n\nBy symmetry, the number of outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is half of the remaining outcomes after subtracting the outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\).

Specifically:\n- \\(d(A, B) = 1\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are adjacent vertices (i.e., they are connected by an edge).\n- \\(d(A, B) = 2\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of two edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 3\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of three edges.\n- \\(d(A, B) = 4\\) if \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are vertices that are connected by a path of four edges.\n\nTo find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\), we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of outcomes. First, let's count the total number of ways to choose three distinct vertices \\(Q, R, S\\) from the 12 vertices of the icosahedron. This is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\times 3! = 220 \\times 6 = 1320\\).\n\nNext, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). We will consider the possible values of \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) and count the number of ways each can occur.\n\n1. If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 2, 3, or 4. There are 12 choices for \\(R\\) and 11 choices for \\(Q\\) (since \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are distinct), and for each choice of \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\), there are 10 choices for \\(S\\) (since \\(S\\) must be distinct from both \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\)). However, we need to ensure that \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) and \\(d(R, S) > 1\\). This means \\(S\\) cannot be adjacent to \\(R\\) or \\(Q\\), so there are 8 choices for \\(S\\) (since \\(S\\) must be at least 2 edges away from both \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\)). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) is \\(12 \\times 11 \\times 8 = 1056\\).\n\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 3 or 4. There are 12 choices for \\(R\\) and 11 choices for \\(Q\\), and for each choice of \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\), there are 8 choices for \\(S\\) (since \\(S\\) must be at least 3 edges away from \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\)). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) is \\(12 \\times 11 \\times 8 = 1056\\).\n\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(d(R, S)\\) can be 4. There are 12 choices for \\(R\\) and 11 choices for \\(Q\\), and for each choice of \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\), there are 6 choices for \\(S\\) (since \\(S\\) must be at least 4 edges away from \\(R\\) and \\(Q\\)). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes for \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) is \\(12 \\times 11 \\times 6 = 792\\).\n\nAdding these up, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(1056 + 1056 + 792 = 2904\\). Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{2904}{1320} = \\frac{121}{55} = \\frac{11}{5}\\). However, we need to simplify this fraction, and we find that the correct probability is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), and the value of \\(m+n\\) is \\(1+2 = 3\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."}

Therefore, there are \\(12 \\times 5 / 2 = 30\\) edges, which means there are 30 pairs of vertices with distance 1. Each vertex is also connected to 5 vertices at a distance of 2, and each of those vertices is connected to 3 new vertices (excluding the original vertex and the vertex at distance 1), so there are \\(12 \\times 5 \\times 3 / 2 = 90\\) pairs of vertices with distance 2. Finally, each vertex is connected to 3 vertices at a distance of 3, and each of those vertices is connected to 1 new vertex (excluding the original vertex, the vertex at distance 1, and the vertex at distance 2), so there are \\(12 \\times 3 \\times 1 / 2 = 18\\) pairs of vertices with distance 3. The remaining pairs are at distance 4.\n\nNow, we need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). For each pair \\((Q, R)\\), there are 11 remaining pairs \\((R, S)\\), and exactly half of them will have a greater distance than \\(d(Q, R)\\) (since the distances are symmetric and there are 4 possible distances). Therefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} = 220\\). For each choice of 3 vertices, there are 2 ways to assign them to \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) and 2 ways such that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and 2 ways such that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\). However, since \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is not possible (as the distances are distinct), we only consider the 2 ways where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) and 2 ways where \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), which gives us a total of \\(220 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 110\\) favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{110}{220} = \\frac{1}{2}\\). The final answer is \\(1 + 2 = \\boxed{3}\\)."}

By the AM-GM inequality, we have:\n\n\\[\n1 + 2a \\geq 2\\sqrt{2a}, \\quad 2 + 2b \\geq 2\\sqrt{4b} = 4\\sqrt{b}, \\quad 2a + b \\geq 2\\sqrt{2ab}\n\\]\n\nMultiplying these inequalities, we get:\n\n\\[\n(1 + 2a)(2 + 2b)(2a + b) \\geq 2\\sqrt{2a} \\cdot 4\\sqrt{b} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2ab} = 16 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\sqrt{2a \\cdot 2ab \\cdot b} = 32 \\cdot \\sqrt{4a^2b^2} = 32 \\cdot 2ab = 64ab\n\\]\n\nThe equality holds when \\(1 + 2a = 2 + 2b = 2a + b\\). Solving these equations, we get \\(a = b = \\frac{1}{2}\\). However, we already found that \\((\\frac{1}{2}, 1)\\) is a solution, not \\((\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})\\).\n\nTo confirm that there are no other solutions, we can use the fact that the function \\((1+2a)(2+2b)(2a+b) - 32ab\\) is strictly positive for \\(a \\neq \\frac{1}{2}\\) and \\(b \\neq 1\\) when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are positive real numbers. Therefore, the only solution is \\((\\frac{1}{2}, 1)\\).\n\nThus, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) that satisfy the equation is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."}

The running total is the sum of the numbers rolled up to a certain point. We need to check all possible sums after each roll to see if they can equal 3.\n\nThe possible sums after each roll are:\n- After the first roll: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n- After the second roll: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n- After the third roll: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\n- After the fourth roll: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\n\nWe need to find the sequences where the running total is 3 at least once. The only way the running total can be 3 is if it is the sum after the first roll or the sum after the second roll is 3. Let's break this down:\n\n1. **First roll is 3**: The sequence is (3).\n2. **Second roll is 3**: The sequence is (1, 2), (2, 1).\n\nNow, we need to check if these sequences can lead to a running total of 3 at any point during the fourth roll. For the sequence (3), it is already a running total of 3 after the first roll. For the sequence (1, 2), the running totals are 1, 3, and 5, which includes a running total of 3. For the sequence (2, 1), the running totals are 2, 3, and 4, which includes a running total of 3.\n\nSo, the valid sequences are:\n- (3)\n- (1, 2)\n- (2, 1)\n\nNext, we need to count the total number of possible sequences of four rolls.

The number of sequences that do not include a running total of 3 is the total number of sequences minus the number of sequences that include a running total of 3 at least once.\n\nThe number of sequences that include a running total of 3 at least once is \\(1296 - 1296 = 0\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that the running total equals 3 at some point is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{7}\\)."}

The running total can only be 3 if the last roll is a 3, or if the running total before the last roll is 0 or 1 (since rolling a 2, 4, 5, or 6 would not allow the running total to be 3 before the last roll).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Sequence ending in 3**: The only way to end in 3 is if the sequence before the last roll is 0 or 1, and the last roll is 3. The only way to get a running total of 0 is to roll a 6, and the only way to get a running total of 1 is to roll a 1.

Therefore, the total number of possible sequences of 4 rolls is:\n\\[\n6^4 = 1296\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Count the sequences where the running total equals 3\nWe will count the sequences where the running total is 3 at the end of each roll and sum these counts.\n\n#### Case 1: Running total is 3 at the end of the first roll\nThis is not possible because the minimum value of a single roll is 1.\n\n#### Case 2: Running total is 3 at the end of the second roll\nFor the running total to be 3 at the end of the second roll, the first roll must be 3, and the second roll can be any number from 1 to 6. There are:\n\\[\n1 \\times 6 = 6 \\text{ sequences}\n\\]\n\n#### Case 3: Running total is 3 at the end of the third roll\nFor the running total to be 3 at the end of the third roll, the sum of the first two rolls must be 3, and the third roll must be 0 (which is not possible). Therefore, there are no sequences in this case.\n\n#### Case 4: Running total is 3 at the end of the fourth roll\nFor the running total to be 3 at the end of the fourth roll, the sum of the first three rolls must be 3, and the fourth roll must be 0 (which is not possible). Therefore, there are no sequences in this case.\n\n### Step 5: Sum the valid sequences\nThe total number of sequences where the running total equals 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n6\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Calculate the probability\nThe probability that the running total equals 3 at some point is the number of favorable sequences divided by the total number of possible sequences:\n\\[\n\\frac{6}{1296} = \\frac{1}{216}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Simplify the fraction\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{1}{216}\\) is already in its simplest form.\n\n### Step 8: Find \\( m + n \\)\nHere, \\( m = 1 \\) and \\( n = 216 \\). Therefore, \\( m + n = 1 + 216 = 217 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{217}\n\\]"}
